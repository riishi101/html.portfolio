<h1>The Best Movies According to Rishi</h1>

<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<P>
    This movie is about a man who travels to Japan to fight for 
    The Japanese Emperor against the Samurai. The Samurai opposed the idea of
    modernisation of the country. They were good people with different opinions.

<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the funniest movies that I have watched. Period.
    The movie is about four friends having a bachelor party in Las Vegas.
</p>

<h3>Tropic Thunder</h3>
<p>
    Another great comedy movie, little bit out of touch nowadays but very 
    funny movie.
</p>

<h3>Intersteller</h3>
<p>
    Intersteller is a sci-fi movie and probabily the best sci-fi movie ever.
</p>

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>
    My favourite anime of all time. Great movie protraying the difficulty faced 
    by teenagers in Japanese Society.
